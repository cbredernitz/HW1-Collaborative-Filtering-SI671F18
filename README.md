# HW1-Collaborative-Filtering-SI671F18
Hw1 for Data Mining (SI671F18) using the Scikit-Surprise package

# Overview

This assignment was for SI671F18 to learn how collabortive filtering works and to build a model for ourselves. After much trial and error, I was able to create a model that performs with an accuracy of ~1.005 Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on a separate unlabled testing set of data. The code found in `Recommender.py` was all written by me with the help of the Surprise package.
